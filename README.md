# dotfiles

This is a repository to keep my dotfiles and other system related scripts. 
I use it to sync between different computing systems. 
Settings for each local computer and remote cluster can be found in the /locations directory. 

Local machines:
- mac (Uthpalas-Macbook-Pro)
- desktop
- desktop2

Remote clusters:
- whitehall (WVU Physics and Astronomy)
- spruce (Spruce Knob WVU High Performance Computing)
- thorny (Thorny Flat WVU High Performance Computing) 
- bridges (Bridges - Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center)
- stampede2 (Stampede2 - Texas Advanced Computing Center)

I basically create symlinks of each of the files in the directories to the system root.
